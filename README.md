To setup the project:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
which will use this script `"start": "live-server"`
3. browser will be opened and `http://127.0.0.1:8080/src/` will be the place where the chat will be hosted.

Probably live-server and other packages/dependencies will be installed, but if not then run:
`npm install live-server --save-dev`
